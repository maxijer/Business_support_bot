# Business_support_bot
This project was created for small, medium and large businesses, since last year the topic of business was very much affected and there was a big decline in sales. It is designed for people who do not know how to program, but they have a goal to transfer their business to telegram. In this case, they are helped by my bot, from which you can rent your bot for sales for a month. It has round-the-clock support, promotions, neural networks that will help the user with determining which goods to purchase, and the most interesting thing is that the server load distribution system is implemented. By the way, these servers were kindly provided to me by Yandex, another interesting thing is linking an account to Bitrex and of course reliable payments through the official telegram methods, which helps to confirm the legality of your business. And in the end, I want to say that it will be easy for you to enter almost any business.

With this project, I won Big challenges and it is worth noting that many people use it. Since I want to turn this project into a startup, I don't want to show the sources, but if you need them, then you can write to me and depending on this, I can share a part.  But in order to understand how it works, I want to leave a video with an example of an ordinary person who created a bot for selling pizza, everything will be very clear on this example.
